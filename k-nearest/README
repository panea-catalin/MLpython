Scripts Description:
1. 1.data_exploration.py

This Python script performs data exploration and analysis on a telecommunications customer dataset (teleCust1000t.csv). It covers the following tasks:

    Data Loading: Loads the dataset from a specified URL using Pandas.
    Data Exploration:
        Displays the count of each category in the 'custcat' column.
        Generates a histogram for the 'income' column to visualize its distribution.
    Feature Set Preparation:
        Selects relevant columns as features (X) and the 'custcat' column as the target variable (y).
    Data Normalization and Splitting:
        Normalizes the data using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
        Splits the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

2. 2.model.py

This Python script builds a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model on the telecommunications customer dataset (teleCust1000t.csv). It includes the following functionalities:

    Data Loading and Preprocessing:
        Loads the dataset from a specified URL using Pandas.
        Prepares feature set (X) and target variable (y).
        Normalizes the data using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
        Splits the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test) using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

    Model Creation and Evaluation:
        Builds a KNN classification model using KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors.
        Trains the KNN model on the training set and predicts on the test set.
        Evaluates the accuracy of the model on both the training and testing sets.
        Determines the best value of k for KNN by testing different numbers of neighbors.

    Output:
        Displays the train set accuracy and test set accuracy of the KNN model.
        Produces a plot showing the accuracy of the model for different numbers of neighbors (K).

Running the Scripts:

    Prerequisites:
        Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).
        Install required libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

    Execution:
        Run 1.data_exploration.py to perform data exploration and prepare the dataset.
        Run 2.model.py to build the KNN classification model and evaluate its performance.

Expected Outputs:
Output of 1.data_exploration.py:

    Counts of each category in the 'custcat' column.
    Histogram showing the distribution of the 'income' column.

Output of 2.model.py:

    Train set accuracy and test set accuracy of the KNN model.
    Plot displaying the model accuracy for different numbers of neighbors (K).
    The best accuracy achieved and the corresponding value of k for the model.
