# Logistic Regression for Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This Python script uses Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.

## Functionality
- Loads the dataset from a provided URL.
- Performs data pre-processing by selecting specific features and converting the target column to integers.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Builds a Logistic Regression model using the training data.
- Evaluates the model using the test data.
- Prints Jaccard index, confusion matrix, classification report, and log loss.

## How to Use
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running:
3. Run the `logistic_regression_telecom.py` script.
4. The script will output evaluation metrics for the Logistic Regression model.

## Why Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is used here because it's suitable for binary classification tasks like predicting customer churn. It predicts the probability of a customer leaving (churn) based on given features.

## Dataset Information
- The dataset contains information about customers leaving a telecommunications company.
- Features include customer demographics, services signed up for, account information, etc.
- Target column: 'churn' (indicating whether a customer left or not).

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Numerical operations and arrays.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building models and evaluation.
