Decision Tree Classifier for Drug Classification

This Python script demonstrates the use of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the appropriate drug for a patient based on their attributes.
Overview

The script uses a dataset containing patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and the drug they responded to. It performs the following steps:

    Data Download: Downloads the dataset from a provided URL.
    Data Preprocessing: Processes the dataset by encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder from scikit-learn.
    Model Training: Splits the data into training and testing sets, then trains a Decision Tree Classifier using the training data.
    Model Evaluation: Predicts drug classes for the test set and evaluates the model's accuracy.
    Visualization: Generates a visualization of the trained decision tree.

Usage

    Requirements:
        Python 3.x
        pandas
        scikit-learn
        matplotlib

    Running the Script:
        Ensure the required libraries are installed in your Python environment.
        Run the script using python your_script_name.py.

    Output:
        The script will display the accuracy score of the model and visualize the decision tree.

File Descriptions

    1.py: The main Python script containing the decision tree classifier implementation.
    drug200.csv: Dataset used for training and testing.

Notes

    The dataset is based on patient attributes and the drugs they responded to, allowing the model to predict a drug for a new patient.
    The decision tree visualization helps understand the decision-making process of the model.
